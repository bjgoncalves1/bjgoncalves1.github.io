  I'm a Data Scientist based in New York City.
  Before I went into the industry, I obtained a Global Supply Chain Management B.Sc from Clarkson University.
  During my internship at Baker Hughes a GE company. I became fascinated with the Industry 4.0, which resulted me to pursue a Masters of Science in Data Analytics.
  I love getting creative with data, working with great people, using state-of-the-art technologies and building innovative products.

      I'm strongly convinced that machine learning models should not go to waste in Jupyter Notebooks.
      Using my Deep Learning skills from Udacity, I've built and deployed AI services which create real business value.
